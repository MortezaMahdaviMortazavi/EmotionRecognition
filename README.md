## Features Extraction Methodology

The features extraction process consists of the following steps:

1. **Hashtags Extraction**: Hashtags are identified in the text by searching for the '#' symbol followed by a word or phrase. This allows for capturing and analyzing the trending topics or themes within the text.

2. **Emojis Extraction**: Emojis are an essential part of modern communication and can convey sentiments or emotions. The extraction process involves identifying and extracting emojis from the text, enabling the analysis of their usage and impact.

3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: POS tagging assigns grammatical labels to words in a text, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. This feature extraction step provides insights into the syntactic structure and grammatical relationships within the text.

4. **Misspell Checking**: Misspellings are common in text data and can impact the accuracy of downstream NLP tasks. The misspell checking step employs a spellchecker to identify and correct misspelled words, enhancing the text quality and reducing noise.
